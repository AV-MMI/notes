# Asymptotic Analisis

> In mathematics an asymptotic line is a line that gets closer and closer to a curve as the distance that it goes through tends or get close to infinity.

> (Of a function) Approaching a given value as an expression containing a variable tends to infinity.

 The efficiently of an algorithm depends on the time, space, and others resources that it needs to run or execute the algorithm itself. The efficiently of an algorithm is measured with the help of the **Asymptotic Analisis**
 
 The Asymptotic Analysis is the study of the changes in the performance of an algorithm as the size of it input also changes.
 
 **The performance of an algorithm** is not always constant, as it can change in based to the size of the input of our algorithm, although there are some algorithms knowns as **Constant-time Algorithms** whose performance don't depend on the size of the input.
