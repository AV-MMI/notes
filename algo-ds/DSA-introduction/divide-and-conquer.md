# Divide and Conquer Algorithm.

 The Divide and Conquer algorithm is an algorithm that help us solve problems decomposing them into sub-problems, so we can solve each sub-problem and then merge them all to solve the main problem.
 
 The DaC approach consist of three steps:
 
**Divide:**

 Divide the main problem into sub-problems.
 
**Conquer:**

 Solve each sub-problem.
 
**Combine**
 Put together all solved sub-problems to solve the main problem.
